tessel-edge
===========

Edge software for [Tessel 2](https://tessel.io/) which forwards [raddecs](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec/) from a reel module (BLE) and tcpdump (WiFi).


Installation
------------

Clone this repository, browse to its root, then run:

    npm install


Configuration
-------------

All configuration parameters can be found in the file __config.js__.  Update only this file, as required.

| Parameter         | Description                                            | 
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| RADDEC_TARGETS    | Array of targets for raddec data (see below)           |
| LISTEN_TO_REEL    | Enable listener on reel module (default: true)         |
| LISTEN_TO_TCPDUMP | Enable listener on tcpdump (default: false)            |
| ENABLE_MIXING     | Combine multiple decodings of an individual transmitter into a single raddec (default: true) |
| INCLUDE_TIMESTAMP | Include the optional timestamp in each raddec (default: true) |
| INCLUDE_PACKETS   | Include the optional packets in each raddec (default: true) |

Each raddec target in the RADDEC_TARGETS array is an object with the following properties:
- _host_: an IP address or hostname (ex: '192.168.0.100')
- _port_: the target port (default: 50001)
- _protocol_: the transport protocol, either 'udp' or 'webhook' (HTTP POST)
- _options_: in the case of a 'webhook' the defaults are { useHttps: false, path: '/raddecs' }, which can be overridden


Programming
-----------

Programming the Tessel 2 requires the [t2-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/t2-cli) package which can be installed by following [these instructions](http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/).

With the Tessel 2 connected to the programming station via USB, from the root of this repository run:

    t2 push index.js

The code will be pushed to flash memory on the Tessel and will run every time it boots.


Prerequisites
-------------

The __tessel-edge__ software expects the following:
- a reel or reelceiver module connected via UART on Port A
- maximum baud rate of Port A set to at least 230400
- tcpdump installed
