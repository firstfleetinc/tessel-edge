tessel-edge
===========

Edge software for the [reelyActive](https://www.reelyactive.com) __Owl-in-One__ based on the [Tessel 2](https://tessel.io/) platform.  Forwards [raddecs](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec/) from a reel module (BLE) and/or from tcpdump (WiFi) to:
- a remote server via UDP and/or webhook (HTTP POST), _and/or_
- an Elasticsearch database, _and/or_
- Google Analytics

Consult the following tutorials for a step-by-step configuration guide:
- [Configure an Owl-in-One](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/oio-config/)
- [Create a WLAN of Owl-in-Ones and a laptop](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/oio-wlan/)


Installation
------------

Clone this repository, browse to its root, then run:

    npm install


Configuration
-------------

All configuration parameters can be found in the file __config.js__.  Update only this file, as required.

| Parameter                 | Description                                     | 
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| RADDEC_TARGETS            | Array of targets for raddec data (see below)    |
| DIRACT_PROXIMITY_TARGETS  | Array of targets for diract-proximity data      |
| DIRACT_DIGEST_TARGETS     | Array of targets for diract-digest data         |
| ES_NODE                   | Path to Elasticsearch node                      |
| IS_UDP_BROADCAST          | Set to true if target is UDP broadcast (default: true) |
| LISTEN_TO_REEL            | Enable listener on reel module (default: true)  |
| LISTEN_TO_TCPDUMP         | Enable listener on tcpdump (default: false)     |
| ENABLE_MIXING             | Combine multiple decodings of an individual transmitter into a single raddec (default: true) |
| MIXING_DELAY_MILLISECONDS | Mixing delay of radio decodings (default: 1000) |
| RADDEC_FILTER_PARAMETERS  | (see raddec-filter)                             |
| INCLUDE_TIMESTAMP         | Include the optional timestamp in each raddec (default: true) |
| INCLUDE_PACKETS           | Include the optional packets in each raddec (default: true) |
| IS_DEBUG_MODE             | Set true and `t2 run index.js` for console log  |

Each raddec target in the RADDEC_TARGETS array is an object with the following properties:
- _host_: an IP address or hostname (ex: '192.168.1.10')
- _port_: the target port (default: 50001)
- _protocol_: either 'udp', 'webhook' (HTTP POST), 'elasticsearch' or 'ua' (Google Analytics)
- _tid_: required only for Google Analytics (ex: 'UA-1234567-8')
- _options_: based on the _protocol_ as follows
    * webhook defaults are { useHttps: false, path: "/raddecs" }
    * ua defaults are { useHttps: true, path: "/collect", page: "/owl-in-one" }

To broadcast UDP to all devices on the subnet, set the _host_ to the corresponding broadcast address (ex: 192.168.1.255) and set IS_UDP_BROADCAST to true.

The DIRACT_PROXIMITY_TARGETS and DIRACT_DIGEST_TARGETS support the 'webhook' and 'elasticsearch' protocols, as described above.


Programming
-----------

Programming the Tessel 2 requires the [t2-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/t2-cli) package which can be installed by following [these instructions](http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/).

With the Tessel 2 connected to the programming station via USB, from the root of this repository run:

    t2 push index.js

The code will be pushed to flash memory on the Tessel and will run every time it boots.


Prerequisites
-------------

The __tessel-edge__ software expects the following:
- a reel or reelceiver module connected via UART on Port A
- maximum baud rate of Port A set to at least 230400
- tcpdump installed
